## ToDo

- think about scrolling logic (I wanna see how it would look like on pdf with pages + I have to be able to click to select)
- refactor by hand to lean React properly
- figure out why image doesn't work
- upload image
- click on text on the right and select on the left (like latex)
- make my own theme + allow which things to show
